the hotfix branch is created to fix the broken email address.
We are now making  changes on the file hotfix.txt  at the branch issue54. 
we are going to back to master branch, create a new branch hotfix2 
and then make the changes on the same file. Then we merge master and hotfix2

then we delete the hitfix2 branch 
go back to iss54 branch, do more work on branch iss54.

Then we decide to merge Master and branch iss54

There should be Merge confict, as we changed the same part of the same file
differently in two branches. Git won't be able to merge them cleanly. 

Now let us go and try this excercise.

Now we are making the changes of this file in branch hotfix2. We have made
changes at the same place in branch iss54.

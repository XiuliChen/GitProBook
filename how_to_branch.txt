git branch iss53 % create a branch
git checkout iss53 % switch to this new branch

Or 

you could do these two at the same time

git checkout -b iss53

Itâ€™s best to have a clean working state when you switch branches. 

Commit all the changes in this new branch before switch back to the 
master branch.

I went back to the master branch. I created a hotfix branch, and fixed 
the urgent issued arised. Then I merged the master and the hotfix branch.
then I deleted the hotfix branch.

(1)git checkout master
(2)git checkout -b hotfix
(3)git checkout master
(3)git merge hotfix
(4)git branch -d hotfix

Finally, I come here to issue53, which was the branch I was working on
before the hotfix emergency.

git checkout iss53

git branch iss53 % create a branch
git checkout iss53 % switch to this new branch

Or 

you could do these two at the same time

git checkout -b iss53

Itâ€™s best to have a clean working state when you switch branches. 

Commit all the changes in this new branch before switch back to the 
master branch.

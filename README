"git mv" does not actually move the file, but it actually more like renaming the files.

It’s important to understand that git checkout -- <file> 
is a dangerous command. Any changes you made to that file are
 gone — Git just copied another file over it.
 Don’t ever use this command unless you absolutely 
know that you don’t want the file.

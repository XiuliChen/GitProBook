In “detached HEAD” state, if you make changes and then create a commit, 
the tag will stay the same, but your new commit won’t belong to any branch
 and will be unreachable, except by the exact commit hash.
 Thus, if you need to make changes — say you’re fixing a bug on an older version,
 for instance — you will generally want to create a branch:

git checkout -b v1.0_mod1 v1.0

Create a new branch called v1.0_mod1, based on v1.0

If you do this and make a commit, 
your v1.0_mod1  branch will be slightly different than your v1.0 tag 
since it will move forward with your new changes, so do be careful.

To see which remote servers you have configured, you can run 
the " git remote"  command.

It lists the shortnames of each remote handle you’ve specified.

For example, origin--this is the default name Git gives to 
the server you cloned from.


git remote add 
nickName https://github.com/XiuliHChen/StudyGitProBook.git


git remote -v
It shows you the URLs that Git has stored for the shortname to 
be used when reading and writing to that remote.

git fetch 
It only downloads the data to you local repository. It does not
automatically merge it with any of your work or modify what you are 
currently working on. You have to merge it manually into your work
when you are ready.

You can use the "git pull" command to automatically fetch then merge
that remote branch inti you current branch.

Running git pull generally fetches data from the server you
 originally cloned from and automatically tries to merge
 it into the code you’re currently working on.
